= SUMMARY =

This module can protect a web site from most common Web Application attacks:

- DoS
- Bad Crawlers (like bots collecting e-mails...)
- SQL Injection
- XSS (not all though)
- System globals pollution
- Session hi-jacking
- Null-bytes
- Directory Traversal
- Some sort of CSRF
- Brute Force
- Camouflaged Image File Uploading (== IE Content-Type XSS)
- Executable File Uploading Attack
- XMLRPC's eval() and SQL Injection Attacks
- SPAMs for comment, trackback etc.

Protector defends from these attacks, and records the activity into its log.

Of course, all vulnerablities can't be prevented.

However, It's recommended to install this module with any version.



= INSTALL =


The XCL install wizard will process the requirements to include in the mainfile.php

and chek the permission to write in _TRUST_PATH/modules/protector/configs

An option "DENY by .htaccess" was added on a previous version.
This option requires to set writable _ROOT_PATH/.htaccess
Before any use of this option, it is recommended to check the security risks if .htaccess is writable.


XOOPS Cube Legacy 2.1

Edit file : mainfile.php
[code]
    if (!defined('_LEGACY_PREVENT_LOAD_CORE_') && XOOPS_ROOT_PATH != '') {
        include XOOPS_TRUST_PATH.'/modules/protector/include/precheck.inc.php' ;
        @include_once XOOPS_ROOT_PATH.'/include/cubecore_init.php';
        if (!isset($xoopsOption['nocommon']) && !defined('_LEGACY_PREVENT_EXEC_COMMON_')) {
            include XOOPS_ROOT_PATH.'/include/common.php';
        }
        include XOOPS_TRUST_PATH.'/modules/protector/include/postcheck.inc.php' ;
    }
[/code]

= How to rescue from 'Access denied' =

If Protector redirects with an "Access Denied" error message or a similar,
just delete the files from _TRUST_PATH/modules/protector/configs/


= Using a filter-plugin =

Protector can be extended with filter-plugins in _TRUST_PATH/modules/protector/filters_byconfig/ just by copying them into filters_enabled.
Since _TRUST_PATH can be shared by multi-sites, it is possible to set a filter enabled for a site but disabled for anoother.
Turn a filter on for a specific site by adding the name of the filter into Protector's preferences.

= Make a filter-plugin =

Make a filter-plugins to a specific purpose is straightforward.

A Quick Introduction to Using Filters-plugins

- postcommon_post_deny_by_rbl.php
an anti-SPAM plugin.
Any Post from a registered IP in RBL will be rejected.
This plugin can slow the performance when Posting, specifically chat modules.

- postcommon_post_deny_by_httpbl.php
an anti-SPAM plugin.
Any Post from a registered IP in http:BL will be rejected.
Before using this filter-plugin, get a HTTPBL_KEY from https://www.projecthoneypot.org/ and add it to the filter file.
define( 'PROTECTOR_HTTPBL_KEY' , 'My HTTPBL_KEY Here' ) ;

- postcommon_post_need_multibyte.php
an anti-SPAM plugin.
Any Post without multi-byte characters will be rejected.
This plugin is mainly for sites in japanese, tchinese, schinese, and korean.

-postcommon_post_htmlpurify4guest.php
All post data sent by guests will be purified by HTMLPurifier.
If a module preferences is set to allow guests posting HTML, it is strongly recommend to enable this filter.

-postcommon_register_insert_js_check.php
This plugin prevents a site from robot's user registering.
Requires JavaScript working on the visitors browser.

-bruteforce_overrun_message.php
Specify a message for visitors that tried wrong passwords more than the specified times.
All plugins named *_message.php specify a message for Access Denied.

-precommon_bwlimit_errorlog.php
When a site exceeded its bandwidth limit this plugin logs it into Apache's error_log.
All plugins named *_errorlog.php log some informations into Apaches error_log.


= LATEST FEATURE : DBLayer trapping anti-SQL-Injection

This feature can defend from almost any malicious SQL Injection attacks if a running module is vulnerable to "SQL Injection".
