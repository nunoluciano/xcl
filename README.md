### Web App Module Management

After you complete the Wizard process, there are lots of options to customize your web app platform : select the modules to install, add modules blocks or custom blocks (HTML, Smarty, HTML) to specific pages, change users and group permissions, customize meta tags (SEO) and localization. X-Update provides a simple click-and-run solution to get all the necessary protection and functionality at the right time. Get and deploy themes, preloads (i.e. plugins), and modules updates.
