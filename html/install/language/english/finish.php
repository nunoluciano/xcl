<h3>XCL Documentation</h3>
<h4>Manual</h4>
<p>XCL core provides an advanced search functionality and for more detailed information refer to the respective documentation from each module Help menu.</p>
<h4>Support</h4>
<p>The Xupdate Manager features an user-friendly interface to update and install free modules and themes for the platform.
Single file extensions (preloads) can also easily be installed via the backend. Extensions can be through the addition of new functionality or through modification of existing functionality. 
The principle provides for enhancements without impairing existing system functions.</p>
