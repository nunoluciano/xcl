    <h3>Additional Themes</h3>
    <p>Themes can be installed from Xupdate Store or from theme-developers' websites etc.

    <h4>Uploading Themes</h4>
    <p>Distributed themes are mostly compressed.
        To use a theme, the uncompressed files must be upload into the /themes directory of your site.
    <p>The Theme folder must include theme.html and manifesto.ini.php.
        First download the theme and expand it on your local machine. Then upload the entire folder.

    <h4>Theme Selection</h4>
    <p>Theme Management allows you to simple click the "Select" button next to the theme
            that you want to use as the default theme or main theme of your site.
    <p>Any theme that is "checked" in the "Control" column, will be available in the Theme Selection Block.
        If you allow users to see this Block, they will then be able to select their favorite theme.

    <h4>Uninstall a Theme</h4>
    <p>The render system manages themes without using the database.
        So, to delete a theme, simply delete it's directory from the "theme" directory.

    <h3>Template Management</h3>
    <p>The list of Template Sets is displayed in Template Management.
    <p>XCL comes with a default Template Set.
        By default, when modules are installed, their templates become part of this default set.
    <p>The default Template Set cannot be deleted nor modified.
        To customize the templates in your site, first 'Clone' the default template set.
    <p>The 'Clone' button is on the right, in the Control column.
    <p>Once you have a new Template Set, you should first make it the Active set
        by clicking the "Select" button in the Control column.
    <p>The actual template files can now be edited in the Template File Management article.
    <p>If you have a template set in tar.gz format, you can also upload this to your site through the admin interface.
    <p>Simply click on the "Upload a Template Set" link in Template Management.
    <h4>Template File Management</h4>
